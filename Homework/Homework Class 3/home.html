    <h2>Blizzard has announced that the next Season of WoW Classic Era will be Season of Discovery, including many new class-changing abilities, allowing new combinations, including Warlock Tank and Mage Healer.</h2>

    <p>World of Warcraft Executive Producer Holly Longdale took to the BlizzCon 2023 stage to announce a new WoW Classic seasonal experience: Season of Discovery.<br>
    In Season of Discovery, players will discover new secrets by scouring Azeroth to find class-altering abilities. Tanking Warlocks, Mage healers, and more will be possible. The Season will launch with an initial level cap of 25, and upon reaching max level, players will be met with a new level-25 endgame! Discover a 10-player Blackfathom Deeps raid with new and reimagined bosses, mechanics, and rewards. Not long after, the level cap will be increased by a few levels, bringing even more endgame content.</p>
